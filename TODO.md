- [x] Update report generation functions (generateCDAReportHTML, generateStreetsReportHTML) to use stored data
- [x] Ensure wardsData calculation uses stored CDAs

### 2. Update CDADirectory.tsx

- [x] Load CDAs and streets from local storage using getStoredCDAs() and getStoredStreets()
- [x] Replace extendedMockCDAs and extendedMockStreets with stored data
- [x] Update groupedData to use stored streets
- [x] Modify handleCdaEditSubmit to use saveCDA() instead of modifying mock array
- [x] Modify handleStreetEditSubmit to use saveStreet() instead of modifying mock array
- [x] Modify confirmDelete to use deleteCDA() and deleteStreet() instead of splicing mock arrays
- [x] Add state management for data refresh after CRUD operations

### 3. Update StreetDetails.tsx

- [x] Load street data from local storage using getStoredStreets()
- [x] Load properties from local storage using getStoredProperties(streetId)
- [x] Update handleStreetSubmit to use saveStreet()

### 4. Update Property Management Components

- [x] Check PropertyForm.tsx and ensure it uses storage functions
- [x] Check PropertyDetails.tsx for any storage integration needed
- [x] Ensure property CRUD operations persist to local storage

### 5. Testing and Validation

- [x] Test CDA creation, editing, deletion with local storage
- [x] Test street creation, editing, deletion with local storage
- [x] Test property creation, editing, deletion with local storage
- [x] Verify totals update correctly after CRUD operations
